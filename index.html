			<h3>About Me</h3>

	<h3>My Philosophy</h3>
		<p class="quote">Life is crazy. You can't live like it's not.</p>
		<p>Life is inherantly and indisputably insane. We can't pretend it's not; we have to come to terms with the parts of life that we can't control and that we don't exactly adore, be that poltics or insects. We have to be able, and what's more, <em>willing</em>, to adapt as the situation demands it, and if that means being a little insanse yourself, that's that.</p>

		<div class="coding">
			<h4>Coding</h4>
			<p class="codep">I love coding and am always learning new languages and aspects of it. While learning languages, I'll often get so excited that I'll start new projects without even finishing the course.</p>
		</div>

		<img src="https://image.flaticon.com/icons/svg/1207/1207811.svg" class="psychimg">
		<div class="psych">
			<h4>Psychology</h4>
			<p class="psychp">Psychology isn't something you'd expect someone like me to fall in love with, but oh well. I love understanding people's motivations, especially what drives some to commit crime.</p>
		</div>

		<img src="https://image.flaticon.com/icons/svg/625/625357.svg" class="karateimg">
		<div class="karate">
			<h4>Karate</h4>
			<p class="karatep">I've been taking Tang Soo Do since the age of four, ever since I completely rejected a trial ballet class. Since then, I've achieved my second-degree black belt. Karate has always been something to turn to when I'm feeling stressed - it never fails to cheer me up, and it's quite therapeutic at times.</p>

		<div class="music">
			<h4>Music</h4>
			<p class="musicp">My taste in music is 70s-80s with the occasional 2010s song thrown in. Favorites include "Piano Man," "Blackbird," "Cat's in the Cradle," "Hey, Soul Sister," and "Hotel California," about which I have actually written an <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/18NUermKSKUfjmGp1yUevFs9IT-yU2mlu9ArFJf1P1vY/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">analysis paragraph</a>.</p>

		<div class="photo">
			<h4>Photography</h4>
			<p class="photop">I love taking pictures of anything, although most of them are of nature. Interestingly, though, my talent for photography only extends to mobile phones. You can see some of my best photos <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/AsR4Hpa9Kp7CmKF87" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

				<h4>Food Allergy Scanner</h4>
				<p class="p1">My brother, along with millions of children nationwide, has severe food allergies. Thus, reading the ingredient labels on food products is a must. These labels, however, are tiny and dense enough that it's a struggle to read them. To remedy this, I created the Food Allergy Scanner. By using this app to scan products' barcodes, users can find out if the product contains their allergens in an instant,  relieving the stress of grocery shopping. This app was made with MIT App Inventor and Thunkable, and is currently availible on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=appinventor.ai_avnig2005.FoodAllergyScannerv1_checkpoint1&hl=en_US" target="_blank">Google Play</a>.</p>
