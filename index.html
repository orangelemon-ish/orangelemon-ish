			<h3>About Me</h3>
			<p>Hi! I'm Avni Gupta. I'm a high school student who loves to learn, be it in school or out. I'm especially passionate about coding and enjoy both web and app development.</p>

	<!--<h3>My Philosophy</h3>
		<p class="quote">Life is crazy. You can't live like it's not.</p>
		<p>Life is inherantly and indisputably insane. We can't pretend it's not; we have to come to terms with the parts of life that we can't control and that we don't exactly adore, be that poltics or insects. We have to be able, and what's more, <em>willing</em>, to adapt as the situation demands it, and if that means being a little insanse yourself, that's that.</p>

		<div class="coding">
			<h4>Coding</h4>
			<p class="codep">I love everything about coding from web development to cybersecurity to quantum computing, and am always learning new languages and aspects of it. While learning languages, I'll often get so excited that I'll start new projects without even finishing the course.</p>
		</div>

		<img src="https://image.flaticon.com/icons/svg/1207/1207811.svg" class="psychimg">
		<div class="psych">
			<h4>Psychology</h4>
			<p class="psychp">Psychology isn't something you'd expect someone like me to fall in love with, but oh well. I love understanding people's motivations, especially what drives some to commit crime.</p>
		</div>

		<img src="https://image.flaticon.com/icons/svg/625/625357.svg" class="karateimg">
		<div class="karate">
			<h4>Karate</h4>
			<p class="karatep">I've been taking Tang Soo Do since the age of four, ever since I completely rejected a trial ballet class. Since then, I've achieved my second-degree black belt. Karate has always been something to turn to when I'm feeling stressed - it never fails to cheer me up, and it's quite therapeutic at times.</p>
		</div>

		<img src="https://image.flaticon.com/icons/svg/873/873352.svg"  class="musicimg">
		<div class="music">
			<h4>Music</h4>
			<p class="musicp">My taste in music is 70s-80s with the occasional 2010s song thrown in. Favorites include "Piano Man," "Blackbird," "Cat's in the Cradle," "Hey, Soul Sister," and "Hotel California," about which I have actually written an <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/18NUermKSKUfjmGp1yUevFs9IT-yU2mlu9ArFJf1P1vY/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">analysis paragraph</a>.</p>

			<h4>Photography</h4>
			<p class="photop">I love taking pictures of anything, although most of them are of nature. Interestingly, though, my talent for photography only extends to mobile phones. You can see some of my best photos <a href="https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipP0ETjMs4vAbgBzhVRV5C86avBRDFSCJNgb5nz_KS4W0gZ4CuAxaodzjQ_pengMxQ?key=M2xLUklISEVUaFBDQTdWeE5MSVJ5X081aXN6bXNB" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

	<h3>Education</h3>
	<div class="edu">
		<h4>Yale's Introduction to Psychology</h4>
			<p class="date">Spring 2020</p>
			<p>I took Yale's Introduction to Psychology course online at <a href="https://www.coursera.org/" target="_blank">Coursera</a>, mostly because my friend was taking it and I thought it might be interesting. It was. This course helped me to discover a genuine interest in psychology, particularly the psychology behind peoples' motivations, and inspired me to continue learning the workings of the mind.</p>
		<h4>Wilton High School</h4>
			<p class="date">Sept 2020-present</p>
			<p>I am currently in high school, where I am a rising sophomore. I enjoy math, English, history, and science, and am part of the debate team and marching band.</p>
		<h4>Quantum Computing Camp</h4>
		<p class="date">July 2020</p>
		<p>I was <a href="file:///home/chronos/u-535b35b6cfe0ba545234c7975d5bcf0e76b32753/MyFiles/Downloads/Avni%20Gupta.pdf" target="_blank">honored</a> to be one of the first high schoolers in the world to learn quantum computing in this virtual crash course summer camp taught by MIT grad students. The camp covered the basics of quantum mechanics, computing, and algorithms, with a special emphasis on quantum cryptography, on which we did several labs, including a replication of the BB84 system of quantum key distribution. Quantum reasearchers from IBM, MIT, and Google, including the inventor of Quantum Chess, held panels as well. Taking this course was truly an amazing opportunity, and opened a whole new world for me. 
		<h4>Mathematical and Computational Research in Biological Sciences</h4>
		<p class="date">June-July 2021</p>
		<p>Over summer 2021, I enrolled in UChicago's Summer Immersion program. This course in computational biology allowed me to combine my two main interests - computation and biology - and learn several basic techniques for genome sequencing, alignment, and more.</p>

				<h4>Food Allergy Scanner</h4>
				<p class="p1">My brother, along with millions of children nationwide, has severe food allergies. Thus, reading the ingredient labels on food products is a must. These labels, however, are tiny and dense enough that it's a struggle to read them. To remedy this, I created the Food Allergy Scanner. By using this app to scan products' barcodes, users can find out if the product contains their allergens in an instant,  relieving the stress of grocery shopping. This app was made with MIT App Inventor and Thunkable, and is currently availible on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=appinventor.ai_avnig2005.FoodAllergyScannerv1_checkpoint1&hl=en_US" target="_blank">Google Play</a>.</p>

				<h4>Whole-Genome Sequencing Using Supercomputation to Identify Various Exonic Disease-Causing Mutations</h4>
				<p class="p2">This paper describes a bioinformatics project I did involving aligning, genotyping, and annotating a human genome with a supercomputer to find variations between the genome and the human reference genome, and then using those variations to identify regions which could cause a condition or disease. The project used UChicago's <a href="https://rcc.uchicago.edu/docs/using-midway/index.html">supercomputer Midway</a>.</p>
